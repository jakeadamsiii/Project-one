Make a one player pokemon battle game. Replicating just the very first battle scenario from pokemon red.
On start the player has only one option, 'press start' that will load the game.
From here a large image loads or fades in.
This will show charmander fighting squirtle.
The player has 2 options (scratch or tail whip).
Scratch, the only attacking move, will do 10hp damage to the opponent.
Tail whip will make your next attack do +2 extra damage.
The opponent then randomly selects which move to use against you.
Battle continues until one players hp turns to zero.
Then a win/lose screen will show, with a play again button.
